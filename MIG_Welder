What can I do with it?
Join mild steel 

How do I use it?
To use the MIG Welder should have had some training. 
Training can be arranged by contacting rob.englebright@gmail.com
For safety sake wear eye protection, non-flammable clothes, gloves and identify location of nearest fire extinguisher.
Danger of burning, electrocution, suffocation and blinding.

To set up the welder connect power supply, and secure earth clamp to metal worksurface. Ensure gas is connected and open the valve. With the welder turned OFF depress the trigger on the handset, you should hear a hiss of gas.
Ensure the room is well ventilated (not draughty) as the CO2 (or Argon ) isn't going to help you breathe.
To set up the welder place a piece of scrap metal the same thickness as your work piece on the work bench. Ensure the metal is clean- wire brush off. 
Set the welder wire speed control and power buttons depending on thickness of your workpiece. See table.

Put on welding mask, check photo reactive lens is working by looking at bright light, it should darken instantly.
Put on gloves.
Turn ON welder.
Test weld on scrap metal, hold handset a short distance from the work, and angle slightly.
Tack work in place before attempting long runs to avoid heat expansion.

DO NOT LOOK AT WELDING ARC! Make sure there is no-one around you who will have to look at welding arc.
If you inadvertently look at the welding arc you may be ok, but it is very easy to burn the back of your eye, this will likley take a few hours and manifest as itchy eyeballs. Seek medical advice.
